That stone... the only reason you're here must be to destroy the Crab Corps.
Who... who are you...?
My name is Petra. 
How did you know... that I wanted to defeat the Crab Corps? 
That's the only thing the stone does. 
Oh. 
The Crab Corps also took my family away. The hot weather murdered my parents.
Oh... I'm so sorry. That happened to my mom too.
You know... it looks like someone can fill that empty hole in your heart.
I have Stan tho.
But... I can offer more than Stan.
But... I have Stan tho.
...
...
Anyways, I want to join your team. I can glide in the sky like a beautiful bullet going through your heart.
I'm sorry but... Stan has already stolen my deep deep deep feelings. There's nothing I have in me left.
It's okay. I'll make you go through it all over again.
Okay you can join our team.
